*OpenCost UI Walkthrough*

# OpenCost â€” your favorite open source cost monitoring tool for Kubernetes

OpenCost models give teams visibility into current and historical Kubernetes spend and resource allocation. These models provide cost transparency in Kubernetes environments that support multiple applications, teams, departments, etc.

OpenCost was originally developed and open sourced by [Kubecost](https://kubecost.com). This project combines a [specification](/spec/) as well as a Golang implementation of these detailed requirements.

To see the full functionality of OpenCost you can view [OpenCost features](https://opencost.io). Here is a summary of features enabled:

- Real-time cost allocation by Kubernetes cluster, node, namespace, controller kind, controller, service, or pod
- Dynamic on-demand asset pricing enabled by integrations with AWS, Azure, and GCP billing APIs
- Supports on-prem k8s clusters with custom CSV pricing
- Allocation for in-cluster resources like CPU, GPU, memory, and persistent volumes.
- Easily export pricing data to Prometheus with /metrics endpoint ([learn more](https://www.opencost.io/docs/installation/prometheus))
- Free and open source distribution ([Apache2 license](LICENSE))
